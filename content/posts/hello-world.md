Welcome to thewind.dev.

This is where I'll be sharing my journey building in public. Writing about AI, engineering, and the random things I'm learning along the way.

## Why a Blog?

In 2026, your online presence is your resume. Every post is proof of work - proof that you're thinking, learning, and creating.

I was inspired by some of my favorite tech bloggers:
- [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/) - Deep technical posts on AI/ML
- [Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/) - ML systems and career
- [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev/) - Practical ML engineering
- [Huyen Chip](https://huyenchip.com/) - ML systems design
- [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/) - Educational ML content

## What to Expect

- Technical tutorials and explanations
- Lessons learned from building things
- Occasional personal reflections

Let's see where this goes.
